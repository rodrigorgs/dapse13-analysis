\begin{abstract}
Bug reports record tasks performed by users and developers while collaborating to resolve bugs. Such data can be transformed into higher level information that helps data scientists understand the aspects of the team's development process. In this paper, we present patterns that show, step by step, how to extract higher level information from bug report data.
